### What is Baskets?
Baskets helps you organize your life by creating beautiful visualizations of your life data.  Use your everyday technology (Smartphones, Fitbit, Mint.com, etc.) to create visual summaries of your life.  We hope to connect with many services--allowing users to track their health, finances, education, and more.



### Behind Baskets
Baskets is a prototype.  It currently parses a CSV file and visualizes the data in a web-page using D3.js.  At the moment, Baskets depicts the data-event name. In future versions, more data will be communicated. It was created in 48 hours at the HackBeanPot hackathon, and while the D3.js visualizations are beautiful--the product is unfinished, and the **real value of Baskets lies in the idea**.

### The Idea 
In the future:

Baskets will sync with many APIs.  Users can select which Baskets they want to view.  Imagine the power of all of your personal data, being collected, interpreted and illustrated to you in one place.

Future 'Baskets' available:
- Finances-- via Mint.com
- Education -- via Blackboard + Piazza 
- Fitness & Sleep -- via - Fitband, JawboneUp, Misfit
